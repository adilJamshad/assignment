# Pipette Calibration

## Scope of work:

This flow is about calculating the accuracy and precision of the pipette. All you need to do is to enter the volume observed by the pipette when the pipette was 100% filled with water.
You will received the mean, standard deviation, percentage accuracy and percentage precision along with the volumes entered.

It took me around 5-6 hours.
